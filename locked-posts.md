Una publicación que está "bloqueada" no puede ser modificada de ninguna manera. El bloqueo impide...

- ...voting on the post (including close/reopen votes for questions)
- ...editing
- ...commenting
- ...answering (for questions)
- ...flagging (though "in need of moderator intervention" flags are still allowed, except in the case of Historical Significance locks - see below)

##Who can lock a post?

[Site moderators](/help/site-moderators) can apply specific types of locks to questions and answers. 

Also, [the system itself](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19738/who-is-the-community-user) will lock posts in certain situations:

- if the post is deleted via ["spam" or "abusive" flags](/help/privileges/flag-posts).
- if the post is migrated to another site.
- if the post was migrated *to* the current site, and then [rejected](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10249/what-is-migration-and-how-does-it-work).
- if a question was merged into another question, the answers will be moved and the source question will be locked.

##How long do posts stay locked?

This depends on why it was locked to begin with. 

- When a moderator locks a post they're required to select how long the lock should remain in place. The options are: 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, permanent. At the end of this time, the system will automatically unlock it.
- When the system locks a post it stays locked indefinitely - only a moderator can unlock it. 

A moderator can manually unlock a locked post at any time if they deem it necessary.

##When should a post be locked?

As a general rule, *temporary* locks should be used whenever modifications to a post are causing serious problems on the site. For example:

- [Edit wars](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/03/04/the-great-edit-wars/)
- Extended bickering in comments (but see: [a guide to moderating comments](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/237978/a-guide-to-moderating-comments))
- A controversial post that is under discussion on meta

*Permanent* locks should almost never be used, with the exception of those imposed by the system itself. There are two exceptions:

1. An extremely popular question which is now considered inappropriate for the site may be locked for "Historical Significance": this alters the appearance of the question, automatically locks all *answers* as well, and disables flagging completely. This lock should be reserved for cases where a cherished cultural artifact would otherwise be deleted; **do not** use it for any other purpose.

2. A "wiki" is a question whose answers [can be edited by low-reputation users](/help/privileges/edit-community-wiki), attributed to multiple authors, and do not grant reputation to the original author. They're occasionally useful in cases where information *must* be compiled by multiple authors (for example, a list of resources or documentation for the site itself); in these cases, locking the question both prevents it from being closed and prevents further answers from being added.
